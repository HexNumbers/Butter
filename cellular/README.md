the cellular automatons make a good picture when displayed on a bright 16x8 LED array  
  
these scripts require cellular-automaton module - https://pypi.org/project/cellular-automaton/
  
starfall and conway's game of life are derived from the module samples  
brian's brain is my implementation - not sure if it's correct, but it does give an image somewhat resembling the truth  
  
try the following:
```
python3 life.py 17
python3 brian.py 4
python3 starfall.py 1000
```
